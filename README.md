Encore is a music live streaming service for the arts. Encore was designed to give all artists (visual artists, musicians, actors, etc.) a platform to show their work with COVID limiting in-person shows. At the same time, Encore focuses on recreating the experience of attending events with friends by allowing for concurrent video chatting while watching an event "together."
